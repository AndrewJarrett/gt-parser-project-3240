For implementing the grammar conversion, we just looked for patterns with how the tokens
would convert. First though was combining all of the same breakdowns into one line that
was | between all the options. After that, it was a matter of using the patterns to convert
lines to not having left recursion and making the new line in the grammar. This was tricky,
but following indices around when hand writing the grammar out made it much easier.
